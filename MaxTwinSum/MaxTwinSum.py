# üß© Pseudocode ‚Äî Max Twin Sum of a Linked List

# Goal:
# Find the maximum sum of ‚Äútwin nodes,‚Äù where the first half of the list is paired with the reversed second half.

# Step-by-step plan

# Find the midpoint of the list

# Use the ‚Äúslow & fast pointer‚Äù technique.

# Move slow by 1 step, fast by 2 steps each iteration.

# When fast reaches the end, slow is at the start of the second half (since n is even).

# Reverse the second half of the list

# Use three pointers (prev, curr, next) to reverse links in place.

# After this step, you‚Äôll have:

# First half: original order.

# Second half: reversed order (starting at prev).

# Use two pointers (left and right)

# left starts at head of first half.

# right starts at head of reversed second half.

# At each step:

# Compute left.val + right.val

# Track the maximum sum.

# Move both pointers forward until right ends (n/2 steps).

# Return the maximum twin sum.
